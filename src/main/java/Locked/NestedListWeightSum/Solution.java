 Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.
 Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

 Example 1:
 Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 10. (four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1)
